This directory (SumOfSquaredErrors) contains files in the form:
k+SUMOFSQ+i+.csv, where k is the number of clusters and every i corresponds
to a similarity metric that was used as the distance function for Kmeans, as follows:

0 = Chisquare
1 = Cosine
2 = Euclidian distance
3 = Hellinger function
4 = Jaccard's coefficient
5 = Jensen-Shannon divergence
6 = Kullback-Leiber divergence
7 = L1 norm
